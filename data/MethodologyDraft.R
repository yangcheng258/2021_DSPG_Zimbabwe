       indices proposed by Alkine and Foster in 2011 involve a matrix with \\(n\\) 
       rows and \\(d\\) columns, where \\(n\\) is the number of people within the 
       state and \\(d\\) is the number of dimensions for assessing poverty. There 
       are three main measurements denoted on the \\(M\\) scale: \\(M_{0}, M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\).
       The A-F method employed in this study contains eight dimensions of poverty. 
       Within each dimension, there are one or two variables that indicate whether 
       or not an individual is deprived in that area. Each variable has a specific
       weight associated with it depending on its contribution to overall poverty
       and how it pertains to rural and urban communities differently. For a given 
       individual, the total number of deprivations are added up and if he or she falls
       above a given threshold, \\(k\\), then that individual is considered poor.

       measure into its individual variables to identify which are contributing 
       most to the overal index of poverty."),

       of the algorithm by multiplying the simple headcount ratio, \\(H\\), by the 
       average deprivation share, \\(A\\). This metric can be thought of as a more
       accurate measure of the simple headcount ratio."),

       assess which individuals are the 'poorest' in the country."),

       poorer individuals who fall farther from the poverty line more heavily to
